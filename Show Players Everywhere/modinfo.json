Intended for use with Rain Meadow, although it can function with Jolly Co-op.<LINE><LINE>Features:<LINE>* Accurate player colors and positions<LINE>* Purely client-side, so the mod works even if no one else has it in Rain Meadow<LINE>* Quick visibility of player icons (they appear faster than the map fades in)<LINE>* Does NOT show you players in other regions, since those other regions use completely separate maps.<LINE>* A questionably simple yet somewhat inefficient implementation. Oh well, at least no bugs!(*)<LINE><LINE>((*)Bugs are a guaranteed part of Rain World mods. That said, I haven't found any yet for this mod. Seems totally stable. It's literally only one hook, so what could go wrong anyway??)",
